    "### Architecture Reference: ARIA (JavaScript)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook translates concepts from advanced JavaScript architectures like ARIA (Adaptive Reasoning Intelligence Architecture) into Python/OpenAI implementations. The original ARIA architecture features:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Example ARIA-style architecture (reference)\n",
    "class QuantumProcessor {\n",
    "  async processWithSuperposition(query) {\n",

    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extend Capabilities**: Add more specialized agents and capabilities\n",
    "2. **Optimize Performance**: Tune parameters based on your use case\n",
    "3. **Add Persistence**: Implement database storage for context and metrics\n",
    "4. **Scale Up**: Deploy to cloud infrastructure with proper monitoring\n",
    "5. **Integrate**: Connect to your existing systems and workflows\n",
